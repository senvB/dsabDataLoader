DSAB data loader

This library can be used to load and parse information from the Deutscher Sportautomatenbund e.V. (DSAB) website (http://www.dsab-vfs.de).

The source code of the library is made available on GitHub: https://github.com/senvB/dsabDataLoader

The data model offered by the library (after parsing the data) is explained in the GitHub wiki (https://github.com/senvB/dsabDataLoader/wiki/Data-model) and also shown in the resources folder.

It is used to read actual (and past) scores for all Darts leagues maintained by the DSAB. A free android app using this library is available on http://dartsviewer.senv.de. The source code of the app will also be offered soon on GitHub.

The library is released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (version 3 or later).
